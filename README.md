# Implementation of ECCOLA - A method for implementing ethically aligned AI system

Vakkuri et al. [1] devised the ECCOLA method, a AI Ethics card-game for discussions related to AI Ethics, based on Planning Poker technique, to be used by a software development team of AI based systems in an agile software development context, which was developed employing the AI HLEG [2] and IEEE EaD v1 [3] AI ethics guidelines.

This method allows developers to implement ethical principles through a deck of cards with topics on AI ethics, with the objective of creating ethical user stories to serve as items in the product backlog.

This repository is an implementation of ECCOLA, working as an interactive guide that can be accessed by the Product Owner, with the development team, when eliciting ethical requirements for AI based systems.

This work was done as a partial result from the research done during the Master in Informatics at the University of Brasília (UnB) by José Antonio Siqueira de Cerqueira, advised by Edna Dias Canedo, and created in collaboration with Anayran Pinheiro de Azevedo.
